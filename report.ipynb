    "<p>The Recurrent Neural Network is a specialized type of Neural Network that solves the issue of <b>maintaining context for Sequential data</b> -- such as Weather data, Stocks, Genes, etc. At each iterative step, the processing unit takes in an input and the current state of the network, and produces an output and a new state that is <b>re-fed into the network</b>.</p>\n",

    "In this project, the character modeling was performed using a LSTM, a particular type of RNN using Tensorflow. TensorFlow's capability to execute the code on different devices such as CPUs and GPUs is a consequence of it's specific computational structure namely data flow graph. We have used this capability to our advantage e.g. in batch processing (parallelism). The result of parallel (GPUs) and serial (CPUs) processing is shown in the following figure. We can observe a 5 fold decrease in computational time with GPUs over CPUs. Therefore, training a deep learning model such as RNN over GPUs can be desirable for large scale computations."
